# 10 - Basic Routing

The most basic Laravel routes accept a URI and a closure, providing a very simple and expressive method of defining routes and behavior without complicated routing configuration files:

```php
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Route;

Route::get('/greeting', function () {
    return 'Hello World';
});
```

### The Default Route Files

All Laravel routes are defined in your route files, which are located in the `routes` directory. These files are automatically loaded by your application's `App\Providers\RouteServiceProvider`. The `routes/web.php` file defines routes that are for your web interface. These routes are assigned the `web` middleware group, which provides features like session state and CSRF protection. The routes in `routes/api.php` are stateless and are assigned the `api` middleware group.

### Available Router Methods

The router allows you to register routes that respond to any HTTP verb:

```php
Route::get($uri, $callback);
Route::post($uri, $callback);
Route::put($uri, $callback);
Route::patch($uri, $callback);
Route::delete($uri, $callback);
Route::options($uri, $callback);
```

Sometimes you may need to register a route that responds to multiple HTTP verbs. You may do so using the `match` method. Or, you may even register a route that responds to all HTTP verbs using the `any` method:

```php
Route::match(['get', 'post'], '/', function () {
    // ...
});

Route::any('/', function () {
    // ...
});
```

> When defining multiple routes that share the same URI, routes using the `get`, `post`, `put`, `patch`, `delete`, and `options` methods should be defined before routes using the `any`, `match`, and `redirect` methods. This ensures the incoming request is matched with the correct route.

### Dependency Injection

You may type-hint any dependencies required by your route in your route's callback signature. The declared dependencies will automatically be resolved and injected into the callback by the Laravel _service container_. For example, you may type-hint the `Illuminate\Http\Request` class to have the current HTTP request automatically injected into your route callback:

```php
use Illuminate\Http\Request;

Route::get('/users', function (Request $request) {
    // ...
});
```

### CSRF Protection

Remember, any HTML forms pointing to `POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH`, or `DELETE` routes that are defined in the `web` routes file should include a CSRF token field. Otherwise, the request will be rejected.

```html
<form method="POST" action="/profile">
  @csrf
  <input type="text" />
</form>
```
