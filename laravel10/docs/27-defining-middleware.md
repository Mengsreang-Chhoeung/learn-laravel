# 27 - Defining Middleware

To create a new middleware, use the `make:middleware` Artisan command:

```shell
php artisan make:middleware EnsureTokenIsValid
```

This command will place a new `EnsureTokenIsValid` class within your `app/Http/Middleware` directory. In this middleware, we will only allow access to the route if the supplied `token` input matches a specified value. Otherwise, we will redirect the users back to the `home` URI:

```php
<?php

namespace App\Http\Middleware;

use Closure;
use Illuminate\Http\Request;
use Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\Response;

class EnsureTokenIsValid
{
    /**
     * Handle an incoming request.
     *
     * @param  \Closure(\Illuminate\Http\Request): (\Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\Response)  $next
     */
    public function handle(Request $request, Closure $next): Response
    {
        if ($request->input('token') !== 'my-secret-token') {
            return redirect('home');
        }

        return $next($request);
    }
}
```

As you can see, if the given `token` does not match our secret token, the middleware will return an HTTP redirect to the client; otherwise, the request will be passed further into the application. To pass the request deeper into the application (allowing the middleware to "pass"), you should call the `$next` callback with the `$request`.

It's best to envision middleware as a series of "layers" HTTP requests must pass through before they hit your application. Each layer can examine the request and even reject it entirely.

> All middleware are resolved via the `service container`, so you may type-hint any dependencies you need within a middleware's constructor.

### Middleware and Responses

Of course, a middleware can perform tasks before or after passing the request deeper into the application. For example, the following middleware would perform some task before the request is handled by the application:

```php
<?php

namespace App\Http\Middleware;

use Closure;
use Illuminate\Http\Request;
use Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\Response;

class BeforeMiddleware
{
    public function handle(Request $request, Closure $next): Response
    {
        // Perform action

        return $next($request);
    }
}
```

However, this middleware would perform its task after the request is handled by the application:

```php
<?php

namespace App\Http\Middleware;

use Closure;
use Illuminate\Http\Request;
use Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\Response;

class AfterMiddleware
{
    public function handle(Request $request, Closure $next): Response
    {
        $response = $next($request);

        // Perform action

        return $response;
    }
}
```
