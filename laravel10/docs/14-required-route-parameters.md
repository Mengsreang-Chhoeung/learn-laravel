# 14 - Required Route Parameters

Sometimes you will need to capture segments of the URI within your route. For example, you may need to capture a user's ID from the URL. You may do so by defining route parameters:

```php
Route::get('/user/{id}', function (string $id) {
    return 'User '.$id;
});
```

You may define as many route parameters as required by your route:

```php
Route::get('/posts/{post}/comments/{comment}', function (string $postId, string $commentId) {
    // ...
});
```

Route parameters are always encased within `{}` braces and should consist of alphabetic characters. Underscores (`_`) are also acceptable within route parameter names. Route parameters are injected into route callbacks / controllers based on their order - the names of the route callback / controller arguments do not matter.

### Parameters & Dependency Injection

If your route has dependencies that you would like the Laravel service container to automatically inject into your route's callback, you should list your route parameters after your dependencies:

```php
use Illuminate\Http\Request;

Route::get('/user/{id}', function (Request $request, string $id) {
    return 'User '.$id;
});
```
