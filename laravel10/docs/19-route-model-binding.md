# 19 - Route Model Binding

When injecting a model ID to a route or controller action, you will often query the database to retrieve the model that corresponds to that ID. Laravel route model binding provides a convenient way to automatically inject the model instances directly into your routes. For example, instead of injecting a user's ID, you can inject the entire `User` model instance that matches the given ID.

## Implicit Binding

Laravel automatically resolves Eloquent models defined in routes or controller actions whose type-hinted variable names match a route segment name. For example:

```php
use App\Models\User;

Route::get('/users/{user}', function (User $user) {
    return $user->email;
});
```

Since the `$user` variable is type-hinted as the `App\Models\User` Eloquent model and the variable name matches the `{user}` URI segment, Laravel will automatically inject the model instance that has an ID matching the corresponding value from the request URI. If a matching model instance is not found in the database, a 404 HTTP response will automatically be generated.

Of course, implicit binding is also possible when using controller methods. Again, note the `{user}` URI segment matches the `$user` variable in the controller which contains an `App\Models\User` type-hint:

```php
use App\Http\Controllers\UserController;
use App\Models\User;

// Route definition...
Route::get('/users/{user}', [UserController::class, 'show']);

// Controller method definition...
public function show(User $user)
{
    return view('user.profile', ['user' => $user]);
}
```

### Soft Deleted Models

Typically, implicit model binding will not retrieve models that have been `soft deleted`. However, you may instruct the implicit binding to retrieve these models by chaining the `withTrashed` method onto your route's definition:

```php
use App\Models\User;

Route::get('/users/{user}', function (User $user) {
    return $user->email;
})->withTrashed();
```

### Customizing the Key

Sometimes you may wish to resolve Eloquent models using a column other than `id`. To do so, you may specify the column in the route parameter definition:

```php
use App\Models\Post;

Route::get('/posts/{post:slug}', function (Post $post) {
    return $post;
});
```

If you would like model binding to always use a database column other than `id` when retrieving a given model class, you may override the `getRouteKeyName` method on the Eloquent model:

```php
/**
 * Get the route key for the model.
 */
public function getRouteKeyName(): string
{
    return 'slug';
}
```

### Custom Keys and Scoping

When implicitly binding multiple Eloquent models in a single route definition, you may wish to scope the second Eloquent model such that it must be a child of the previous Eloquent model. For example, consider this route definition that retrieves a blog post by slug for a specific user:

```php
use App\Models\Post;
use App\Models\User;

Route::get('/users/{user}/posts/{post:slug}', function (User $user, Post $post) {
    return $post;
});
```

When using a custom keyed implicit binding as a nested route parameter, Laravel will automatically scope the query to retrieve the nested model by its parent using conventions to guess the relationship name on the parent. In this case, it will be assumed that the `User` model has a relationship named `posts` (the plural form of the route parameter name) which can be used to retrieve the `Post` model.

If you wish, you may instruct Laravel to scope "child" bindings even when a custom key is not provided. To do so, you may invoke the `scopeBindings` method when defining your route:

```php
use App\Models\Post;
use App\Models\User;

Route::get('/users/{user}/posts/{post}', function (User $user, Post $post) {
    return $post;
})->scopeBindings();
```

Or, you may instruct an entire group of route definitions to use scoped bindings:

```php
Route::scopeBindings()->group(function () {
    Route::get('/users/{user}/posts/{post}', function (User $user, Post $post) {
        return $post;
    });
});
```

Similarly, you may explicitly instruct Laravel to not scope bindings by invoking the `withoutScopedBindings` method:

```php
Route::get('/users/{user}/posts/{post:slug}', function (User $user, Post $post) {
    return $post;
})->withoutScopedBindings();
```

### Customizing Missing Model Behavior

Typically, a 404 HTTP response will be generated if an implicitly bound model is not found. However, you may customize this behavior by calling the `missing` method when defining your route. The `missing` method accepts a closure that will be invoked if an implicitly bound model can not be found:

```php
use App\Http\Controllers\LocationsController;
use Illuminate\Http\Request;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Redirect;

Route::get('/locations/{location:slug}', [LocationsController::class, 'show'])
        ->name('locations.view')
        ->missing(function (Request $request) {
            return Redirect::route('locations.index');
        });
```

## Implicit Enum Binding

PHP 8.1 introduced support for `Enums`. To complement this feature, Laravel allows you to type-hint a `string-backed Enum` on your route definition and Laravel will only invoke the route if that route segment corresponds to a valid Enum value. Otherwise, a 404 HTTP response will be returned automatically. For example, given the following Enum:

```php
<?php

namespace App\Enums;

enum Category: string
{
    case Fruits = 'fruits';
    case People = 'people';
}
```

You may define a route that will only be invoked if the `{category}` route segment is `fruits` or `people`. Otherwise, Laravel will return a 404 HTTP response:

```php
use App\Enums\Category;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Route;

Route::get('/categories/{category}', function (Category $category) {
    return $category->value;
});
```

## Explicit Binding

You are not required to use Laravel's implicit, convention based model resolution in order to use model binding. You can also explicitly define how route parameters correspond to models. To register an explicit binding, use the router's `model` method to specify the class for a given parameter. You should define your explicit model bindings at the beginning of the `boot` method of your `RouteServiceProvider` class:

```php
use App\Models\User;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Route;

/**
 * Define your route model bindings, pattern filters, etc.
 */
public function boot(): void
{
    Route::model('user', User::class);

    // ...
}
```

Next, define a route that contains a `{user}` parameter:

```php
use App\Models\User;

Route::get('/users/{user}', function (User $user) {
    // ...
});
```

Since we have bound all `{user}` parameters to the `App\Models\User` model, an instance of that class will be injected into the route. So, for example, a request to `users/1` will inject the `User` instance from the database which has an ID of `1`.

If a matching model instance is not found in the database, a 404 HTTP response will be automatically generated.

### Customizing the Resolution Logic

If you wish to define your own model binding resolution logic, you may use the `Route::bind` method. The closure you pass to the `bind` method will receive the value of the URI segment and should return the instance of the class that should be injected into the route. Again, this customization should take place in the `boot` method of your application's `RouteServiceProvider`:

```php
use App\Models\User;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Route;

/**
 * Define your route model bindings, pattern filters, etc.
 */
public function boot(): void
{
    Route::bind('user', function (string $value) {
        return User::where('name', $value)->firstOrFail();
    });

    // ...
}
```

Alternatively, you may override the `resolveRouteBinding` method on your Eloquent model. This method will receive the value of the URI segment and should return the instance of the class that should be injected into the route:

```php
/**
 * Retrieve the model for a bound value.
 *
 * @param  mixed  $value
 * @param  string|null  $field
 * @return \Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model|null
 */
public function resolveRouteBinding($value, $field = null)
{
    return $this->where('name', $value)->firstOrFail();
}
```

If a route is utilizing `implicit binding scoping`, the `resolveChildRouteBinding` method will be used to resolve the child binding of the parent model:

```php
/**
 * Retrieve the child model for a bound value.
 *
 * @param  string  $childType
 * @param  mixed  $value
 * @param  string|null  $field
 * @return \Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model|null
 */
public function resolveChildRouteBinding($childType, $value, $field)
{
    return parent::resolveChildRouteBinding($childType, $value, $field);
}
```
