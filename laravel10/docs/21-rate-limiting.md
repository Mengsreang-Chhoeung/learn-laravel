# 21 - Rate Limiting

## Defining Rate Limiters

Laravel includes powerful and customizable rate limiting services that you may utilize to restrict the amount of traffic for a given route or group of routes. To get started, you should define rate limiter configurations that meet your application's needs.

Typically, rate limiters are defined within the `boot` method of your application's `App\Providers\RouteServiceProvider` class. In fact, this class already includes a rate limiter definition that is applied to the routes in your application's `routes/api`.php file:

```php
use Illuminate\Cache\RateLimiting\Limit;
use Illuminate\Http\Request;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\RateLimiter;

/**
 * Define your route model bindings, pattern filters, and other route configuration.
 */
protected function boot(): void
{
    RateLimiter::for('api', function (Request $request) {
        return Limit::perMinute(60)->by($request->user()?->id ?: $request->ip());
    });

    // ...
}
```

Rate limiters are defined using the `RateLimiter` facade's `for` method. The `for` method accepts a rate limiter name and a closure that returns the limit configuration that should apply to routes that are assigned to the rate limiter. Limit configuration are instances of the `Illuminate\Cache\RateLimiting\Limit` class. This class contains helpful "builder" methods so that you can quickly define your limit. The rate limiter name may be any string you wish:

```php
use Illuminate\Cache\RateLimiting\Limit;
use Illuminate\Http\Request;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\RateLimiter;

/**
 * Define your route model bindings, pattern filters, and other route configuration.
 */
protected function boot(): void
{
    RateLimiter::for('global', function (Request $request) {
        return Limit::perMinute(1000);
    });

    // ...
}
```

If the incoming request exceeds the specified rate limit, a response with a 429 HTTP status code will automatically be returned by Laravel. If you would like to define your own response that should be returned by a rate limit, you may use the `response` method:

```php
RateLimiter::for('global', function (Request $request) {
    return Limit::perMinute(1000)->response(function (Request $request, array $headers) {
        return response('Custom response...', 429, $headers);
    });
});
```

Since rate limiter callbacks receive the incoming HTTP request instance, you may build the appropriate rate limit dynamically based on the incoming request or authenticated user:

```php
RateLimiter::for('uploads', function (Request $request) {
    return $request->user()->vipCustomer()
                ? Limit::none()
                : Limit::perMinute(100);
});
```

### Segmenting Rate Limits

Sometimes you may wish to segment rate limits by some arbitrary value. For example, you may wish to allow users to access a given route 100 times per minute per IP address. To accomplish this, you may use the `by` method when building your rate limit:

```php
RateLimiter::for('uploads', function (Request $request) {
    return $request->user()->vipCustomer()
                ? Limit::none()
                : Limit::perMinute(100)->by($request->ip());
});
```

To illustrate this feature using another example, we can limit access to the route to 100 times per minute per authenticated user ID or 10 times per minute per IP address for guests:

```php
RateLimiter::for('uploads', function (Request $request) {
    return $request->user()
                ? Limit::perMinute(100)->by($request->user()->id)
                : Limit::perMinute(10)->by($request->ip());
});
```

### Multiple Rate Limits

If needed, you may return an array of rate limits for a given rate limiter configuration. Each rate limit will be evaluated for the route based on the order they are placed within the array:

```php
RateLimiter::for('login', function (Request $request) {
    return [
        Limit::perMinute(500),
        Limit::perMinute(3)->by($request->input('email')),
    ];
});
```

## Attaching Rate Limiters to Routes

Rate limiters may be attached to routes or route groups using the `throttle middleware`. The throttle middleware accepts the name of the rate limiter you wish to assign to the route:

```php
Route::middleware(['throttle:uploads'])->group(function () {
    Route::post('/audio', function () {
        // ...
    });

    Route::post('/video', function () {
        // ...
    });
});
```

### Throttling With Redis

Typically, the `throttle` middleware is mapped to the `Illuminate\Routing\Middleware\ThrottleRequests` class. This mapping is defined in your application's HTTP kernel (`App\Http\Kernel`). However, if you are using Redis as your application's cache driver, you may wish to change this mapping to use the `Illuminate\Routing\Middleware\ThrottleRequestsWithRedis` class. This class is more efficient at managing rate limiting using Redis:

```php
'throttle' => \Illuminate\Routing\Middleware\ThrottleRequestsWithRedis::class,
```
