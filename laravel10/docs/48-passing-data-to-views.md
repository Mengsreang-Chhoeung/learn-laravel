# 48 - Passing Data to Views

As you saw in the previous examples, you may pass an array of data to views to make that data available to the view:

```php
return view('greetings', ['name' => 'Victoria']);
```

When passing information in this manner, the data should be an array with key / value pairs. After providing data to a view, you can then access each value within your view using the data's keys, such as `<?php echo $name; ?>`.

As an alternative to passing a complete array of data to the `view` helper function, you may use the `with` method to add individual pieces of data to the view. The `with` method returns an instance of the view object so that you can continue chaining methods before returning the view:

```php
return view('greeting')
            ->with('name', 'Victoria')
            ->with('occupation', 'Astronaut');
```

## Sharing Data With All Views

Occasionally, you may need to share data with all views that are rendered by your application. You may do so using the `View` facade's `share` method. Typically, you should place calls to the `share` method within a service provider's `boot` method. You are free to add them to the `App\Providers\AppServiceProvider` class or generate a separate service provider to house them:

```php
<?php

namespace App\Providers;

use Illuminate\Support\Facades\View;

class AppServiceProvider extends ServiceProvider
{
    /**
     * Register any application services.
     */
    public function register(): void
    {
        // ...
    }

    /**
     * Bootstrap any application services.
     */
    public function boot(): void
    {
        View::share('key', 'value');
    }
}
```
