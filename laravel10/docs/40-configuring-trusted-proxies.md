# 40 - Configuring Trusted Proxies

When running your applications behind a load balancer that terminates TLS / SSL certificates, you may notice your application sometimes does not generate HTTPS links when using the `url` helper. Typically this is because your application is being forwarded traffic from your load balancer on port 80 and does not know it should generate secure links.

To solve this, you may use the `App\Http\Middleware\TrustProxies` middleware that is included in your Laravel application, which allows you to quickly customize the load balancers or proxies that should be trusted by your application. Your trusted proxies should be listed as an array on the `$proxies` property of this middleware. In addition to configuring the trusted proxies, you may configure the proxy `$headers` that should be trusted:

```php
<?php

namespace App\Http\Middleware;

use Illuminate\Http\Middleware\TrustProxies as Middleware;
use Illuminate\Http\Request;

class TrustProxies extends Middleware
{
    /**
     * The trusted proxies for this application.
     *
     * @var string|array
     */
    protected $proxies = [
        '192.168.1.1',
        '192.168.1.2',
    ];

    /**
     * The headers that should be used to detect proxies.
     *
     * @var int
     */
    protected $headers = Request::HEADER_X_FORWARDED_FOR | Request::HEADER_X_FORWARDED_HOST | Request::HEADER_X_FORWARDED_PORT | Request::HEADER_X_FORWARDED_PROTO;
}
```

> If you are using AWS Elastic Load Balancing, your `$headers` value should be `Request::HEADER_X_FORWARDED_AWS_ELB`. For more information on the constants that may be used in the `$headers` property, check out Symfony's documentation on [trusting proxies](https://symfony.com/doc/current/deployment/proxies.html).

### Trusting All Proxies

If you are using Amazon AWS or another "cloud" load balancer provider, you may not know the IP addresses of your actual balancers. In this case, you may use \* to trust all proxies:

```php
/**
 * The trusted proxies for this application.
 *
 * @var string|array
 */
protected $proxies = '*';
```
