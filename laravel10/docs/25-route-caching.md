# 25 - Route Caching

When deploying your application to production, you should take advantage of Laravel's route cache. Using the route cache will drastically decrease the amount of time it takes to register all of your application's routes. To generate a route cache, execute the `route:cache` Artisan command:

```shell
php artisan route:cache
```

After running this command, your cached routes file will be loaded on every request. Remember, if you add any new routes you will need to generate a fresh route cache. Because of this, you should only run the `route:cache` command during your project's deployment.

You may use the `route:clear` command to clear the route cache:

```shell
php artisan route:clear
```
